- Option to create timestamp-based output folders, in case you want to do multiple versions of the same one


# v3 - Upgrade and More Polish

- Options Menu created
- Mouse Mode moved to Options menu
- Background color now visible in a box at the top so you can't miss it like I do
- You can also toggle off the Background Color Box if it bothers you or you don't think you need it in the Options Menu
- Or even better you can click the BG Color box to eyedrop if you solely want to rely on singular button input
- You can also preview the BG Color's Hex Code (for double confirmation) thanks to "Show Hex"
- Arrow keys allow you to select back and forth between images within the folder(s) selected
- Preview Mode allows you to preview either the last image rendered or your future render based on the mouse hover (off by default)
- Added icon :)
- Removed the god awful command prompt (changed file type to python gui)
- Changed filetree (less accessible to new users)
- Background options all moved to a singular branch under Options menu 
- Background box location is able to be changed from top or bottom

# v3.1 - Tweaks

- Images now load in the center for you to make it easier to click
- Multiple render options at once!
- Multiple preview windows at once! (Not multiple modes though, I feel like that's overwhelming)
- Manual added
- Made text on background color picker more visible/accessible/dynamic
- Error for no images selected moved to BEFORE the filestamp option, and then reprompts you to select a folder

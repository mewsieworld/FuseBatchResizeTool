# PLEASE NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED THE .BAT OR .PS1 FILES!!!!

THESE ARE FOR MY RELEASE PURPOSES ONLY BUT I AM TOO LAZY TO MOVE THEM FROM THE FOLDER
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THESE TWO FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

# You only need:

* __main__
* config
* mewsiepto (optional)
* resizer_app
* resolution_picker
* stats_manager
* utils

You also need pillow. Get it with ```pip install pillow```
